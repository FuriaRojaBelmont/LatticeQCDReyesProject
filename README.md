# LatticeQCDReyesProject

This files first organize the data provided by Reyes 2024 summer project number 13 on Lattice QCD in managable csv files. Then it applies jacknife error analysis, applies a simple logarithm of a fraction between previous and next data in a dataframe and finally plots the results with a plateau.

Execute first Data_treating2.py, then AverageEqualMomenta.py (if you require to average diferent data within the dataframe), finally execute Analysis.py

Any doubts of questions can be forwarded contacting romandariogm@gmail.com, yours truly :D
